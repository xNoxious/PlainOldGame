#PlainOldGame
This is a game that I made in Unity to showcase my C# and Unity knowledge. None of the assets used in the game are created by me and they have all been taken from the Unity Asset Store.

#How to run
Fork the repository and either launch the index page via Firefox or do "chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files" to add a flag to Chrome to allow it to access local storage. Otherwise Chrome would complain and won't open the game which is running via WebGL.

Note: There is a pretty obvious bug that I have left in on purpose - to see if you've actually played the game (if you did - you'd definitely know what the bug is).

I can provide complete source code upon request as well as a version without the bug so you can enjoy the rest of the game upon request.
Don't forget to pet the cat - it's so cute.
