#PlainOldGame

This is a game that I made in Unity to showcase my C# and Unity knowledge. None of the assets used in the game are created by me and they have all been taken from the Unity Asset Store.

Note: There is a pretty obvious bug that I have left in on purpose for a few reasons:
1. To see if you've actually played the game (if you did - you'd definitely know what the bug is)
2. Remind me that this one bug cost me getting a remarkable degree that I could make everyone jealous with he-he.

I can provide complete source code upon request as well as a version without the bug so you can enjoy the rest of the game upon request.
Please, pet the cat - it's so cute.
