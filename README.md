University: Newcastle University 2018-2019

This is a prototype of the game I am making for my Computer Games Development module at Newcastle University. None of the artistic content belongs to me and has been acquired from Unity's Asset Store. The assets are placed in folders with their respective names as they were displayed in the Asset Store.

Each class has a description at its top describing the classess' purpose and the person/source that implemented it before I modified it for the game's purposes where relevant.
